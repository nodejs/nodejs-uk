This repository began as a GitHub fork of
[joyent/node](https://github.com/joyent/node).

io.js contributions, releases, and contributorship are under an
[open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md).
We intend to land, with increasing regularity, releases which are
compatible with the npm ecosystem that has been built to date for
Node.js.
